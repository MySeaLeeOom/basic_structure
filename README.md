# **Mycelium Notes**

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by [adiler], [maahof], [myakoven], [pvasilan] and [grmullin].* 

## **I. Description**

A modular open-source personal knowledge management system with built-in real-time collaboration.

## **II. Instructions**

### Prerequisites

* Docker Engine with Compose v2 (`docker compose` subcommand).
* A GitHub OAuth App for authentication (Client ID and Client Secret).
* `make` (GNU Make).

### Setup

1. **Environment variables** — Create `srcs/.env` with the following variables (the Makefile will auto-populate `UID` and `GID`):

```
DB_USER=<postgres superuser>
DB_PASSWORD=<postgres superuser password>
DB_NAME=<main database name>
AUTH_DB_USER=<auth service db user>
AUTH_DB_NAME=<auth service db name>
POSTGRES_ADDR=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your GitHub OAuth app client ID>
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/github/callback
AUTH_PORT=3000
NOTES_ADDR=http://notes:3003
NOTES_PORT=3003
FRONTEND_ADDR=http://frontend:3000
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
WEBSITE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

2. **Secrets** — Copy the example secrets directory and fill in real values (one value per file):

```bash
cp -r srcs/secrets.example srcs/secrets
```

The following secret files must be populated: `auth_db_password`, `github_client_secret`, `session_secret_key`, `grafana_admin_user`, `grafana_admin_password`, `todo_db_password`.

### Execution

```bash
make up        # Build all images and start in detached mode
make live      # Build and start in foreground (logs stream to terminal)
make down      # Stop all containers
make logs      # Follow logs (optionally: make logs service=auth)
make clean     # Stop containers and remove images
make cleanv    # clean + remove node_modules and frontend build cache volumes
make fclean    # Destructive: removes everything including database volumes
make re        # clean + rebuild
```

The application is accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. Grafana dashboards are at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
cp -r srcs/secrets.example srcs/secrets
```

The following secret files must be populated: `auth_db_password`, `github_client_secret`, `session_secret_key`, `grafana_admin_user`, `grafana_admin_password`, `todo_db_password`.

### Execution

```bash
make up        # Build all images and start in detached mode
make live      # Build and start in foreground (logs stream to terminal)
make down      # Stop all containers
make logs      # Follow logs (optionally: make logs service=auth)
make clean     # Stop containers and remove images
make cleanv    # clean + remove node_modules and frontend build cache volumes
make fclean    # Destructive: removes everything including database volumes
make re        # clean + rebuild
```

The application is accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. Grafana dashboards are at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Team information

Ahmed Diler - Principal Developer
Maarten Hoff - Technical Lead
Masha Mashenkova - Product Owner
Pavlos Vasilantonakis - Project Manager
Grace Mullin - Manager of Development

## **IV. Project management**

Explain your workflow.

* **Organization**: Features were decided early. The main sync-time was a weekly in-person meeting with additional video calls between subsets of the team. Team members expressed interest in specific subject modules early and were encouraged to take ownership. The product owner was tasked with mantaining a forward momentum, the technical lead was asked to solve any ties in relation to tech and the project lead attempted to partially disengage from the everyday coding in order to keep the rest of the team motivated.

* **Tools**: 
    Github Issues for matching commits to issues
    Slack for everyday communication
    Github projects for the gratification of the Project Manager

## **V. Technical stack**

* **Frontend**: Nuxt 4 / Vue 3 with TailwindCSS, PrimeVue, and Pinia. TipTap provides the rich-text editor; Yjs and y-websocket handle real-time collaborative editing via CRDTs. Framework choice satisfies the 42 curriculum requirement.
* **Auth service** (TypeScript): Fastify 5 with Drizzle ORM. Handles OAuth (GitHub, Google, 42) and local password auth (Argon2). Session-based authentication with cookie tokens. Exposes Prometheus metrics via `prom-client`.
* **Notes service** (Rust): Axum + sqlx. CRUD API for note metadata. Chosen for low overhead on a high-frequency path.
* **Editor service** (Rust): Axum with WebSocket support + Yrs/y-sync. Persists Yjs CRDT document state to PostgreSQL. Handles real-time sync between collaborating clients.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL 16. Two logical databases in a single instance — one for auth (users, accounts, sessions), one for notes and document state. Relational model fits the structured data; UUID primary keys throughout.
* **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose orchestrates 10 services behind an Nginx reverse proxy. Nginx gates `/api/notes` and `/ws/` routes through an `auth_request` subrequest to the auth service. Prometheus scrapes all application and infrastructure targets; Grafana provides pre-provisioned dashboards. Exporters for Nginx and PostgreSQL round out observability.

## **VI. Database schema**

Two logical databases in a single PostgreSQL 16 instance.

**Auth database** (Drizzle ORM, migrations in `auth/drizzle/`):

| Table | Columns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | `id` (UUID PK), `email` (unique), `login_name` (unique, not null), `image_url`, `role` (enum: user/admin), `status` (enum: active/blocked/suspended), `created_at` | Central identity table |
| `accounts` | `id` (UUID PK), `user_id` (FK → users, cascade), `provider` (enum: github/local/google/42), `provider_account_id`, `password_hash` | Unique on (provider, provider_account_id). One user can have multiple provider accounts |
| `sessions` | `id` (UUID PK), `user_id` (FK → users, cascade), `token` (UUID, unique), `expires_at`, `user_agent`, `ip_address` | Cookie-based session tracking |

**Main database** (SQL init in `postgres/init/02-init.sql`):

| Table | Columns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `notes` | `id` (UUID PK), `title` (varchar 255), `owner_id` (UUID), `created_at`, `updated_at` | Note metadata |
| `note_states` | `note_id` (UUID PK, FK → notes, cascade), `state_vector` (BYTEA), `last_saved_at` | Persisted Yjs CRDT state, 1:1 with `notes` |

**Key relations**: one user → many accounts (multi-provider auth), one user → many sessions, one note → one note_state. All foreign keys cascade on delete.
